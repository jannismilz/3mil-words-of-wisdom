# Introduction

Precisely, on the **1st of June 2023** (22nd calendar week), I started with a so-called "Monk Mode" phase with a friend of mine. It's a lifestyle you pursue during a specified time, in my case, 23 days.

One of the additional rules we imposed on ourselves was to read _one book a week_ in the direction of knowledge-building, self-improvement, and growth. In my case, I had to read three books in this period, but I actually ended the phase with four books read.

Even after our monk mode session, I continued to read one book a week and turned it not just into a mission but into a habit. To the very end of this year, I continued my habit and read a total of _35 books_ since the 1st of June.

I created this book review, **3 Million Words of Wisdom**, because I wanted to have something I could look at in the future and say, "I did this in 2023, so I can definitely do whatever it takes now as well."

I encourage you, the reader, to look at what interests you and take from it what you think can help you. Happy reading!
